### Important command line obtained from this project

## What is NPM

npm is the world's largest Software Registry.

The registry contains over 800,000 code packages.

Open-source developers use npm to share software.

Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.

## npm init -y

Using npm init --yes to Instantly Initialize a Project If you want to get on to building your project and don't want to spend the (albeit brief) time answering the prompts that come from npm init , you can use the --yes (or -y ) flag on the npm init command to populate all options with the default values automatically.

## npm run lint

When you execute npm run lint, it triggers a command defined in the scripts section of the package.json file. Usually, this command runs a specific linting tool configured for the project, which then scans your codebase according to predefined rules and standards, highlighting any issues found.

## npm run lint -- --debug

This command executes the lint script defined in your package.json file with an additional argument --debug.

    npm run lint: This runs the script named lint as defined in the scripts section of the package.json file. The purpose of a lint script is often to check code for stylistic or programming errors according to predefined rules.

    -- --debug: The -- is used to pass additional arguments to the script being executed. In this case, --debug is passed as an argument to the lint script. The --debug argument might trigger additional logging or debugging information within the linting process. The specific effect of the --debug flag depends on how the lint script is implemented and whether it's designed to recognize and respond to this particular argument.

So, the overall command runs the lint script and supplements it with the --debug argument, potentially enabling additional debugging features or output related to the linting process.
