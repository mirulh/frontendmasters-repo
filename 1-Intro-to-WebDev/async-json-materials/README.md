Promise Chaining

In promise chaining, we use the then() method to chain multiple asynchronous operations. This is useful when we have multiple asynchronous operations that need to be performed in a specific order.

Async - Await

Async/await allows us to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code. The async keyword is used to declare a function as asynchronous, and the await keyword is used to wait for the result of a promise.

Async - Await is better than Promise Chaining
