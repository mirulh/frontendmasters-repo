      <p>Here are some interesting accomplishment about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I was lucky to been awarded a type of scholarship to further my
          studies in a university
        </li>
        <li>
          I always thinks about dropping out and learn on my own as all the
          materials best find on the web
        </li>
        <li>
          But I cannot afford the risk, and just stick with the process and find
          balance I guess
        </li>
